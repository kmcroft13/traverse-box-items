# Introduction #
This script will traverse all items in a Box instance, and optionally allows for custom business logic (defined by the user) to be performed on each item retreived during traversal. Some additional features are offered which allow for more "advanced" capabilities such as a simulation mode to skip modifying data, a blacklist to skip processing of certain users or folders, and a whitelist to only process certain folders explicitly.

# Getting Started #
You must already have your Box application [set up and authorized](https://developer.box.com/docs/setting-up-a-jwt-app) in your Box instance. You must also have Node 8 or above installed on your machine.

Once complete, follow the steps below to run the script:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the downloaded directory: `cd traverse-box-items`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the script: `node traverse-box-items.js`
5. View results in the console or in the newly created `auditLogs` and `runtimeLogs` directories in the script root directory

***NOTE***: At any meaningful scale, the default configurations in this script will cause Node to utilize more than its allowed maximum memory utilization. You can increase Node's available memory at runtime by adding the `--max-old-space-size=XXXX` flag when executing the script, where `XXXX` is the amount of memory in MB that you want to allocate to Node for this process execution.

For example, running `node --max-old-space-size=12884 traverse-box-items.js` will allocate 12GB of memory to this Node process at runtime. See [Important Note on Performance and Resource Utilization](https://github.com/kmcroft13/traverse-box-items#important-note-on-performance-and-resource-utilization) for additional information.

# Features #
Below is a summary of the features offered by this script:

## Item Traversal ##
Out of the box this script will simply traverse all files, folders, and web links (ie. bookmarks) for all users in a Box instance. It will start by getting all users in the Box instance and then it will impersonnate each user to get the items they own. It will log all items to an audit CSV file for review.

### Traversal with Metadata ###
If a metadata template is included in the config `boxItemFields` option (see [Config File](https://github.com/kmcroft13/traverse-box-items#config-file)) it will automatically be included with the Box item object during traversal. Corresponding metadata instance values on a particular item will be automatically be logged to the Audit Log CSV (if the `auditTraversal` config option is enabled). All metadata instance properties are flattened and normalized for you, and available on applicable Box items under the `metadata` item object key.

To enable metadata traversal, an additional value should be added in config `boxItemFields` comma-separated list in the form of "metadata.enterprise.{{templateKey}}", where {{templateKey}} is the key (not display name) of the metadata template you want to include in traversal results. For exmaple, to include traversal results for Box items which may have a metadata instance with template "sampleTemplate" applied the corresponding value to be added to config option `boxItemFields` would be `metadata.enterprise.sampleTemplate`.

## User Cache and Task Queue ##
This script implements an `userCache` object which contains a Box user object, Box API client, and user-specific task queue for every in scope user that the script will process. Each object entry's key is defined by the Box user ID for which it represents, and every function is designed to use the relevant user context (Box API client) and tasks queue based on a user ID passed to that function.

The task queue ensures that Box is not overwhelmed by requests, which would trigger Box rate limiters, which can back up script execution, cause high memory utilization, and eventually failures. Box rate limits are defined on a per-user basis and as such task queues are also defined on a per-user basis. Therefore, this script will perform the maximum number of tasks per user task queue per second as defined in the `maxQueueTasksPerSecond` configuration option.

## User Defined Business Logic ##
During traversal the script will call a function `performUserDefinedActions` for each item processed. The script user can specify custom business logic in this function which will be evaluated for every item. This is useful if, for example, you need to modify shared link access levels or apply retention policies to items. You can see a sample implementation in the "User Defined Logic Examples" folders.

All custom Business Logic must be defined within the user-defined-logic.js file, where the `performUserDefinedActions` function is defined. The following data is available to you at function execution:

    ownerId [string]: User ID for the user who owns the item
    itemObj [object]: A Box item (file, folder, or web_link) object which can be processed or evaluated for processing
    parentExecutionID [string]: The execution ID from the loop which triggered the function

## Process Non-Owned Items ##
By default the script is configured to skip items not owned by the user associated with the calling Box API client. This prevents the script from processing duplicate items for collaborated folders. However, there may be cases where you want to process non-owned, collaborated items especially when used in conjunction with the whitelist feature to limit the scope of which items the script will process.

## CSV ##
Instead of iterating through all users, the script can be configured to pull a pre-defined set of items to process from a CSV file. The CSV requires 3 columns with one of the following headers each: `item_id` OR `Folder/File ID`, `owner_login` OR `Owner Login`, and `type` OR `Path`. Conveniently, the second of each of these headers match ones produced by some of Box's native reporting. This is useful if you already know the scope of the items you want to take action on (for example, by pulling a Shared Link or Folders and Files report from Box).

## Blacklist ##
The blacklist feature allows the user to configure specific users or folders to skip during processing. If these items are encountered during traversal, they will be skipped and no action will be performed. The item will be logged in runtime logs but will not be captured in audit event logs. The blacklist accepts an array of user IDs and / or an array of folder IDs.

## Whitelist ##
The whitelist feature allows the user to configure specific combinations of users and folders explicitly process. When the whitelist is enabled, no other items besides the ones explicitly configured will be processed. Items not included in the whitelist will not be processed and will not be included in the runtime logs or in audit event logs.
The whitelist is an array of objects. Each object requires two elements: `ownerID` and `folderIDs`.
* `ownerID` is a string representing the user ID for the user who owns the whitelisted folders.
* `folderIDs` is an array of strings representing the folder IDs which should be processed in the whitelist. All folder IDs within this array must be owned by the `ownerID` user defined above.
* `followAllChildItems` is a boolean which specifies whether or not the whitelist should apply to all child items throughout an entire structure, or if the whitelist should only apply to the specified item and its immediate children. In technical terms, controls whether or not recursion is performed.

## Simulation Mode ##
If adding custom User Defined Business Logic, it is recommended to implement a "simulation mode" by leveraging the `modifyData` config flag. If the flag is `true` you can perform the actual action associated with your custom logic, while if the flag is `false` you can implement an audit log only version that does not actually modify any data. You can see a sample implementation in the example file.

# Logging #
## Audit Logging ##
A `logAudit` function is exposed to write items to an audit CSV file which write actions the script performs. Audit logging is already implemented for basic traversal (and can be disable via config file). If adding custom User Defined Business Logic, you may also choose to audit your custom actions with this function. This function requires the following parameters:

    @param {string} action: Action that is being audited
    @param {object} boxItemObj: Box item object (folder, file, web_link)
    @param {string} message: Additional details about the event
    @param {string} executionID: Unique ID associated with a given execution loop

A new audit log file will be generated each time the script is executed. This file can optionally be automatically uploaded to Box when the script completes. See the [Config File section](https://github.com/kmcroft13/traverse-box-items#config-file) for configuration details.

## Runtime Logging ##
Audit logging is separate from runtime logs which are also collected during execution. Runtime logs are implemented through a series of `logger` methods. See [Winston documentation](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for info about these methods, or view the various examples already implemented in the script.

# Examples #
The following User Defined Logic examples were built for common use cases. to use an example file, simply copy code form the example file and paste into the `user-defined-logic.js` file!

## modifySharedLinks ##
Will check the current shared links of all items and, if the access level matches a certain value, will change the access level. For example, this example can change all "Open" (Public) shared link to "Company Only" shared links.

To leverage this example, the following configuration options must be added to the `userDefinedConfigs` object in [config.json](https://github.com/kmcroft13/traverse-box-items#config-file):
* matchSharedLinkAccessLevel: Current shared link access level you want to act upon
* newSharedLinkAccessLevel: Access level to change the shared link to

Possible options for these configuration values are: "open", "company", "collaborators"

# Important Note on Performance and Resource Utilization #
The configuration defaults included with this script are tuned for high performance. By increasing or decreases values for the `maxConcurrentUsers` config option and, to a lesser extent, the `maxQueueTasksPerSecond` config option, you can also increase or decrease performance of the script.

With increased performance comes increased resource utilization. While CPU, memory, and network resources will all be hightly utilized, the limiting factor will likely be memory. Even with the default configuration options, the script will likely utilize more memory that is available to the Node process by default. Each version of Node may have a different default heap size, but you can allocate additional memory to the Node process at runtime by adding the `--max-old-space-size=XXXXX` flag when executing the script, where `XXXXX` is the amount of memory in MB that you want to allocate for this process execution. **This will be required at any meaningful scale.**

Even increasing the `maxConcurrentUsers` option by an increment of 1 can have a big impact on resource utilization, especially if the content in your Box instance is spread evenly across many users. The default options are set to allow the script to complete successfully on a well powered desktop machine with 14GB of memory allocated (ie. `--max-old-space-size=15032`). If the machine that is executing this script is less powerfull, decrease resource utilization by decreasing `maxConcurrentUsers` and decrease memory allocation. If you need even greater performance, run this script from a more powerful machine (like a server) and increase `maxConcurrentUsers` and increase memory allocation.

Note that `maxQueueTasksPerSecond` should not be increased from the default value of 16 unless certain users in your Box instance have been granted an alternative rate limit threshold (this will not be the case for the vast majority of script users).

## Example Real World Utilization ##
This script has been successfully used with the default configuration values and 14GB of memory allocated (ie. `--max-old-space-size=15032`) on a Box enterprise with nearly 1000 users, over 20TB of content, and over 9.2 million objects (files, folders, weblinks). Peak memory usage was just over 13GB and total runtime took 22 hours.
